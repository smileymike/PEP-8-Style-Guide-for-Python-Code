# comments.py
'''
Comments that contradict the code are worse than no comments. Always make a
priority of keeping the comments up-to-date when the code changes!

Comments should be complete sentences. The first word should be capitalized,
unless it is an identifier that begins with a lower case letter (never alter
the case of identifiers!).

Block comments generally consist of one or more paragraphs built out of complete
sentences, with each sentence ending in a period.

You should use two spaces after a sentence-ending period in multi- sentence
comments, except after the final sentence.

Ensure that your comments are clear and easily understandable to other speakers
of the language you are writing in.

Python coders from non-English speaking countries: please write your comments in
English, unless you are 120% sure that the code will never be read by people who
don't speak your language.
