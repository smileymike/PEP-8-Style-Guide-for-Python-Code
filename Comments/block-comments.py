# block-comments.py
'''
Block comments generally apply to some (or all) code that follows them, and are
indented to the same level as that code. Each line of a block comment starts
with a # and a single space (unless it is indented text inside the comment).

Paragraphs inside a block comment are separated by a line containing a single #.
