# inline-comments.py
'''
Use inline comments sparingly.

An inline comment is a comment on the same line as a statement. Inline comments
should be separated by at least two spaces from the statement. They should start
with a # and a single space.

Inline comments are unnecessary and in fact distracting if they state the
obvious.

# Don't do this:
x = x + 1                 # Increment x

# But sometimes, this is useful:
x = x + 1                 # Compensate for border
