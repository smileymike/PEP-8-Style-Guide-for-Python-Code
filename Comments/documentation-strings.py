Conventions for writing good documentation strings (a.k.a. "docstrings") are
immortalized in PEP 257.

    Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods.
    Docstrings are not necessary for non-public methods, but you should have a
    comment that describes what the method does. This comment should appear
    after the def line.

    PEP 257 describes good docstring conventions. Note that most importantly,
    the """ that ends a multiline docstring should be on a line by itself:
'''

"""Return a foobang

Optional plotz says to frobnicate the bizbaz first.
"""

# For one liner docstrings, please keep the closing """ on the same line.
