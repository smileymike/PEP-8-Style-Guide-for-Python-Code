'''The naming conventions of Python's library are a bit of a mess, so we'll
never get this completely consistent -- nevertheless, here are the currently
recommended naming standards. New modules and packages (including third party
frameworks) should be written to these standards, but where an existing library
has a different style, internal consistency is preferred.
