# Wrong:
# operators sit far away from their operands
incomde = (gross-wages +
           taxable_interest +
           (dividends - qualified_dividends) -
           ira_deduction -

# Correct:
# easy to match operators with operands
income = (gross_wages

          + (dividends - qualified_dividends)
          - ira_deduction -
